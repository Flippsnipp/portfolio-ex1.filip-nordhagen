                My Semester Project
              </h3>
              <p>
                My semester project was to create a website for a company called Eduplaytion AS using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
                They have created a game called "Numetry", that can get children that struggles with math back on track.
                My goal was to lift it from being a website created for children/pupils to be something that could
                sell to adults/teachers. I focused on celebrity marketing and more deliberately explaining how this 
                game could benefit the kids. The goal was to make it responsive for platforms such as Mobile, Pads and Desktop.
              </p>
              <p>
                I got a "C" for this semester project.

                My HTLM & CSS Project
              </h3>
              <p>
                This project was to create a website for a "company" called Re-cycle using HTML and CSS.
                The logo I created myself. I chose the beautiful city of Barcelona, Spain. I tried to display allot of colors, 
                since the city itself is very colorful. The page should be eco friendly and focus on environment. 
                The page offers guided tours around the city 
                The goal was to make it responsive for platforms such as Mobile, Pads and Desktop.
              </p>
              <p>
                I passed the Assignment, with room for allot of improvement.

                My Design1 Project
              </h3>
              <p>
                This was one of my first projects. The Assignment was to create a Styletile for a company called Red Pepper Pizza
                using Adobe Illustrator. We had to create a Logo and a color-pallet and find Fonts, photos and icons that we would like to use.
                I chose an Italian rustica theme for this assignment. The link includes my technical report for the assignment.
              </p>
              <p>
                I passed the Assignment, with room for improvement.
