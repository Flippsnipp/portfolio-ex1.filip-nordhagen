              <h3>
                My Semester Project
              </h3>
              <p>
                My semester project was to create a website for a company called Eduplaytion AS using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
                They have created a game called "Numetry", that can get children that struggles with math back on track.
                My goal was to lift it from being a website created for children/pupils to be something that could
                sell to adults/teachers. I focused on celebrity marketing and more deliberately explaining how this 
                game could benefit the kids. The goal was to make it responsive for platforms such as Mobile, Pads and Desktop.
              </p>
              <p>
                I got a "C" for this semester project.

                My HTLM & CSS Project
              </h3>
              <p>
                This project was to create a website for a "company" called Re-cycle using HTML and CSS.
                The logo I created myself. I chose the beautiful city of Barcelona, Spain. I tried to display allot of colors, 
                since the city itself is very colorful. The page should be eco-friendly and focus on the environment. 
                The page offers guided bike tours around the city. 
                The goal was to make it responsive for platforms such as Mobile, Pads and Desktop.
              </p>
              <p>
                I passed the Assignment, with room for allot of improvement.

                My Design1 Project
              </h3>
              <p>
                This was one of my first projects. The Assignment was to create a Styletile for a company called Red Pepper Pizza
                using Adobe Illustrator. We had to create a Logo and a color-pallet and find Fonts, photos and icons that we would like to use.
                I chose an Italian rustica theme for this assignment. The link includes my technical report for the assignment.

                I passed the Assignment, with room for improvement.
