            My semester project was to create a website for a company called Eduplaytion AS. 
            They have created a game called "Numetry", that can get children that struggles with math back on track.
            My goal was to lift it from being a website created for children/pupils to be something that could
            sell to adults/teachers. I focused on celebrity marketing and more deliberately explaining how this 
            game could benefit the kids. The goal was to make it responsive for platforms such as Mobile, Pads and Desktop.
